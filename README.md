# P2P Ride Pooling
Course project for graduate level course CIS6930: Blockchain at University of Florida.<br>
A website which allows users to book cab rides and manages payments using Blockchain.<br>
The rider is able to set source and destination points for their ride. A driver is then assigned to the rider based on their relative proximity to other drivers.<br>
The driver is able to track the rider once the ride has been confirmed. It is also possible to pick up multiple riders based on their preferences to pool a ride.<br>
The fare for the ride is calculated based on the route taken. Upon reaching their destination, the driver is paid the fare amount in ethers.<br>
